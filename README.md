## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **11 years of Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) Point of Sale (POS) 
transaction data** (January 2015 – March 2026) and builds a **24-month Prophet 
machine learning forecast** (April 2026 – March 2028).

The final deliverable is a **4-page interactive Power BI dashboard** combining 
historical analysis, business insights, ML forecasting, and model component analysis.

> 💡 **What is POS data?** Every time a Saudi resident pays by card at a shop, 
> restaurant, or online — that transaction is recorded. SAMA publishes monthly totals 
> for the entire country. This dataset reflects the growth of Saudi Arabia's 
> cashless economy under Vision 2030.

## 🎯 Key Findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| 📈 **5x Growth** | Monthly POS sales grew from ~14B SAR (2015) to ~66B SAR (2026) |
| 💰 **Total Revenue** | 4.64 Trillion SAR in card transactions over 11 years |
| 🏆 **All-Time High** | March 2026 = 66.14B SAR — highest single month ever recorded |
| 🕌 **Ramadan Effect** | Annual dips of -6% to -9% detected automatically by Prophet |
| 📅 **Peak Month** | March is consistently the highest spending month every year |
| 🔮 **Forecast** | Monthly sales projected: 64B (2026) → 68B (2027) → 71B (2028) |
| 🇸🇦 **Vision 2030** | Growth directly reflects Saudi Arabia's cashless economy push |

## 📊 Model Accuracy

The Prophet model was validated using **cross validation across 13 historical 
time windows** (2019–2025):

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **MAE** | 3.53 Billion SAR | Average monthly prediction error |
| **RMSE** | 4.54 Billion SAR | Weighted prediction error |
| **MAPE** | **8.85%** | Model predicts within 8.85% of actual values |

> ✅ Under 10% MAPE is considered strong accuracy for macro-level economic 
> forecasting — especially given COVID-19 disruption in 2020 and annual 
> Ramadan calendar shifts.

## 🔍 Prophet Model Configuration

```python
model = Prophet(
    yearly_seasonality=True,           # Capture yearly patterns
    weekly_seasonality=False,          # Monthly data — no weekly patterns
    daily_seasonality=False,           # Monthly data — no daily patterns
    seasonality_mode='multiplicative', # Seasonal effect grows with trend
    changepoint_prior_scale=0.1,       # Moderate trend flexibility
    seasonality_prior_scale=10,        # Strong seasonality detection
    interval_width=0.95                # 95% confidence interval
)
model.add_country_holidays(country_name='SA')  # Saudi holidays including Ramadan
```

## 📈 What the Model Detected Automatically

### 1. Long-Term Trend
Saudi POS transactions grew nearly **5x** from 14B to 70B+ SAR over 13 years,
reflecting Vision 2030's cashless economy initiative.

### 2. Ramadan Holiday Effect
Prophet automatically detected annual dips of **-6% to -9%** during Ramadan 
each year — without being explicitly told about Islamic holidays.

### 3. March Seasonality Peak
March is consistently the **highest spending month** (+100% above baseline),
followed by a sharp April–May decline reflecting post-Ramadan behavior.
